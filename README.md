# SeedAdditionSynthesis
Synthesis of seed addition diversity experiments effect on species richness and ecosystem function

Code DOI:

This project uses **seed addition experimental data** , and includes the **summarised data**  used for analyses and models,  the **model objects**, and the **R scripts** to investigate and understand models, process data, and generate results and figures.

### Data
Four datasets and six model objects are included in the project.

**Species Level Data** For species level data please contact lead author.

**Plot Level Data** These data summarise species richness and aboveground level biomass responses to a range of diverse seeding treatments across 12 seed addition and diversity experiments.

**Beta Diversity** These data summarise the turnover and nestedness components of Beta diversity responses to a range of diverse seeding treatments across 12 seed addition and diversity experiments.

**Effective Number of Species** These data summarise the effective number of species responses to a range of diverse seeding treatments across 12 seed addition and diversity experiments.

**Bayesian Model Objects** There are six model objects included in this project used in the main paper. These provide the model information without needing to run computationally intensive models again. Code to create each model is included in the R scripts.

### **R Scripts** 
Fourscripts are provided in this repository.

**Main_Analysis.R** Includes all data , model objects, and code to conduct analyses and produce figures found in the main manuscript. This code produces Figure 1-3 and Figures S1a-f.

**Multivariate_Model.R** Includes data and multivariate model object used to understand the correlation between species richness and biomass.

**raw_plot.R** Includes data and code to produce Figure S2.

**div.R** Includes data, model object and analyses used to understand the effect of seeded richness on the effective number of species. this code produces Figure S3.

**Beta.R** Includes data, model objects and analyses used to understand the effect of seeded richness on the turnover and nestedness components of Beta diversity. This code produces Figure S4.
